## Creating the client
The first thing we have to do is create an API client that will execute the resources against the API and return the parsed responses asynchronously.
> UnsplashClient supports passing a closure that returns extra headers to be inserted in a given request. For example, these headers can contain the user authentication in the Authorization header.
*/

var client = UnsplashClient { request -> [String: String] in
    return [ "Authorization": "Client-ID \(token)"]

/*:
## Requests
Models expose the requests that can be executed as resources. A resource contains the request, and how the response should be parsed. For example `User.me` returns the resource to fetch the authenticated user.
*/

 Some examples of these resources could be:
